This project is from [Bootstrap npm starter template](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-npm-starter)

My aim is to create a ready-to-use project structure (using node, bootstrap, and simple HTML/CSS), to save time on making a number of decisions on what to use and what not to use.

## Using The Template

### Click on the "Use Template Button"

This will prompt you to create a new repo from your account using the project's files.

### Install the dependencies

Ensure that you are in working folder/directory. Install the dependencies by running:

```node
npm install
```

### Build bootstrap css

To get a built bootstrap css, run

```node
npm run build
```

This will create a new directory

```shell
assets/css/bootstrap/starter.css
```

Where the compiled bootstrap css will be added

### Run Locally

To run the project locally/development mode, use

```node
npm start
```
