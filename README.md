# Javascript Environment

## Project Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ChrisAchinga/js-environment.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ChrisAchinga/js-environment)

This project is from [Bootstrap npm starter template](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-npm-starter)

My aim is to create a ready-to-use project structure (using node, bootstrap, and simple HTML/CSS), to save time on making a number of decisions on what to use and what not to use.

## Using The Template

1. Click on the "Use Template Button" or clone it using

```git
git clone 
```
